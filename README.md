# workout-diary Spring boot application
To see code please switch branch

26.11.2020
Welcome to my workout diary app, at this point it's pretty pre-alpha stage of my web application. I made couple of basic backend functionality like database access, add predefined roles using spring security and put some endpoints of my model classes(but only for logged users). At this moment it doesn't offer any end-user experience besides possibility of login. In future releases I'm planning add gui using vaadin framework and provide new functionality like weight tracker and workout tracker. All records will be stored in database and history of records will be accessed for user.
